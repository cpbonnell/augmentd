# augmentd
A project for exploring data structures and algorithms while making musical jokes.


## A Prelude
You are a recent hire at a stealth startup, named Augment'd. The CEO says that the name is a music related word, except cooler because it's missing a letter.

The goal of this start up is to produce a musical social media platform that connects fans with the songs from musicians they lust after, and to connect musicians with the dollars they lust after from fans.

The CEO hasn't really figured out exactly how everything will be accomplished yet, but your job is to work with the the front end developer, Alejandro, and the data scientist, Franchesca, to supply whatever software they need.
