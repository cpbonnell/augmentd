# augmentd
A humorous exploration of data structures and music theory.


## A Prelude
You are a recent hire at a stealth startup, named Augment'd. The CEO says that the name is a music related word, except cooler because it's missing a letter.

The goal of this startup is to produce a musical social media platform that connects fans with the songs from musicians they lust after, and to connect musicians with the dollars they lust after from fans.

The CEO, **Jay** hasn't really figured out exactly how everything will be accomplished yet, but he believes in having a strong vision and leaving the details to his highly capable employees. You will get requests for work from the front end developer, **Alejandro**, and from the data scientist, **Franchesca**, to support whatever work they are working. Alejandro and Franchesca have been in an on-again-off-again relationship for years. Jay says this means they have good "conflict resolution skills," and is excited about the "dynamic energy" they bring to the company.

The company also has an overpaid and pretentious music consultant, **Jean Pierre**, who often sets the requirements and definitions for various projects from his glass walled corner office while he chain smokes cigarettes. He considers himself to be a jazz aficionado and wears a trademark black beret everywhere, but you've also cought him dancing around his office after hours while listening to NSYNC.
