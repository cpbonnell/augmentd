# Augment'd
**A humorous exploration of Algorithms and Data Structures using Music Theory.**

## Format
The material is presented as a series of code puzzles. Each puzzle is a useful and interesting new feature in the context of our fictional startup. Before each puzzle, your instructor will review a set of key concepts that are required to solve the upcoming puzzle, and teach any material that you aren't already familiar with. You will then be given the puzzle in the form of a "ticket" and the narrative context about how the particular techniques being taught can actually provide real world business value.

I teach the lessons through one-on-one pair coding with my students. We each connect remotely to a VS Code instance running on GitHub Codespaces, and each student gets their own branch. As I add new content to the main branch, I can rebase the student branches to include the new lessons.

Since I am using the book to teach lessons in 1-1 sessions, the lessons only contain "notes to the instructor" on what specific principles, techniques or algorithms should be taught or reviewed before attempting that code puzzle. If you are using this book to teach yourself, you may want to pair it with a textbook such as [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/introduction-to-algorithms_clifford-stein_thomas-h-cormen/254823/?resultid=02cf4738-83cd-4c82-b099-1d5a719979b6#edition=59682683&idiq=51622871).

The startup and the characters are all strictly fictional, and any resemblance to real entities is strictly coincidental.


## Our Setting
You are a recent hire at a stealth startup, named Augment'd. The CEO says that the name is a music related word, except cooler because it's missing a letter.

The goal of this startup is to produce a musical social media platform that connects fans with the songs from musicians they lust after, and to connect musicians with the dollars they lust after from fans.

The CEO, **Jay** hasn't really figured out exactly how everything will be accomplished yet, but he believes in having a strong vision and leaving the details to his highly capable employees. You will get requests for work from the front end developer, **Alejandro**, and from the data scientist, **Franchesca**, to support whatever tasks they are doing. Alejandro and Franchesca have been in an on-again-off-again relationship for years. Jay says this means they have good "conflict resolution skills," and is excited about the "dynamic energy" they bring to the company.

The company also has an overpaid and pretentious music consultant, **Jean Pierre**, who often sets the requirements and definitions for various projects from his glass walled corner office while he chain smokes cigarettes. He considers himself to be a jazz aficionado and wears a trademark black beret everywhere, but you've also glimpsed him dancing around his office after hours while listening to NSYNC and Justin Beber.


## The Material
The topics in this course cover the typical material you will find in an undergraduate course titled something like "Algebraic Data Structures", "Advanced Programming", "Principles of Computer Science" or something equally as cryptic and taught using CLRS or Weiss. More commonly, we in the software engineering business just refer to it as "Data Structures and Algorithms."

No knowledge of music theory is required to understand the material, but it will definitely give you additional insight into some of the principles. Because let's face it, music theory is really just cleverly disguised set theory.

While our primary objective is to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, the presentation uses a wide array of other typical tools and techniques from the industry, so you will learn those along the way by pair coding with your instructor. To name just a few of the extras:

- Analysis of runtime and memory, using "Big O" notation
- Language "style guides" and code readability
- Git and GitHub
- The command line
- Abstraction and the reuse of code
- Refactoring
- The practice of peer-reviewing code
- Tickets and Ticketing Systems



## Project Origins

I have a long professional history in Maths and Machine Learning. My father was a Jazz musician, but I was always focused on STEM while growing up. A few years ago, however, I started learning Jazz Piano from a delightful young teacher with a degree in Philosophy. I finally convinced him that I was really serious about learning Jazz for its own sake, and that I really wanted to play "Autumn Leaves" in the key of Bb (because I wanted to do it like Bill Evans, rather than the Real Book). He promptly threw me in the deep end, delivering in-depth music theory while simultaneously starting on Autumn Leaves. It was without a doubt the most enjoyable and rewarding learning experience of my life, because my teacher gave me difficult subject matter to wrestle with, then gave me the tools to handle it, and then let me take the time to struggle with and master the material.

Even after he retired from teaching, we stayed good friends and had periodic evenings of wine and Wittgenstein. A year or so later my teacher told me he had been learning Python, with the goal of becoming a Data Scientist. He had learned the language itself, but felt he had stagnated and didn't know how to progress further. He wanted to know "how to do something real" with it. I smiled internally, knowing exactly the feeling he was talking about. I also knew this was my time to take revenge on him for having me memorize all 84 seventh chords. The result is this book. It is very much a work in progress, which changes as I teach the material in 1-1 lessons to several people.

If you too would like piano lessons from a creative musician who doesn't mind tackling ambitious songs with you, you can find my teacher [here](http://www.fiverr.com/s/3BEBDk).
