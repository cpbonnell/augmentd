# augmentd
A humorous exploration of data structures and music theory.


## Our Setting
You are a recent hire at a stealth startup, named Augment'd. The CEO says that the name is a music related word, except cooler because it's missing a letter.

The goal of this startup is to produce a musical social media platform that connects fans with the songs from musicians they lust after, and to connect musicians with the dollars they lust after from fans.

The CEO, **Jay** hasn't really figured out exactly how everything will be accomplished yet, but he believes in having a strong vision and leaving the details to his highly capable employees. You will get requests for work from the front end developer, **Alejandro**, and from the data scientist, **Franchesca**, to support whatever work they are doing. Alejandro and Franchesca have been in an on-again-off-again relationship for years. Jay says this means they have good "conflict resolution skills," and is excited about the "dynamic energy" they bring to the company.

The company also has an overpaid and pretentious music consultant, **Jean Pierre**, who often sets the requirements and definitions for various projects from his glass walled corner office while he chain smokes cigarettes. He considers himself to be a jazz aficionado and wears a trademark black beret everywhere, but you've also glimpsed him dancing around his office after hours while listening to NSYNC and Justin Beber.


## The Material
While our primary objective is to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, the presentation uses a wide array of other typical tools and techniques from the industry, so you will learn those along the way just by pair coding with your instructor. To name just a few of the extras:

- Analysis of runtime and memory, and "Big O" notation
- Language "style guides" and code readability
- Git and GitHub
- Tickets and Ticketing Systems
- The command line
- Abstraction and the reuse of code
- Refactoring

## Format
The material is presented as a series of code puzzles. Each puzzle is a useful and interesting new feature in the context of out hypothetical startup. Before each puzzle, your instructor will review a set of key concepts that are required to solve the upcoming puzzle, and teach any material that you aren't already familiar with. You will then be given the puzzle in the form of a "ticket" and the narrative context about how the particular techniques being taught can actually provide real world business value.
