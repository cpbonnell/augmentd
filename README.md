# augmentd
A musical about data structures and algorithms at a social media startup.


## A Prelude
You are a recent hire at a stealth startup, named Augment'd. The CEO says that the name is a music related word, except cooler because it's missing a letter.

The goal of this startup is to produce a musical social media platform that connects fans with the songs from musicians they lust after, and to connect musicians with the dollars they lust after from fans.

The CEO hasn't really figured out exactly how everything will be accomplished yet, but you will get requests for work from the front end developer, **Alejandro**, and the data scientist, **Franchesca**, to supply whatever software they need. The company also has an overpaid and pretentious jazz consultant, **Jean Pierre**, who often sets the requirements and definitions for various projects from his glass walled corner office while he chain smokes cigarettes.
