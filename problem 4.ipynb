    "Alejandro has just finished work on a project for Jay. Jay is worried that with the odd office hours everyone keeps, they might not always put in the full time hours they are getting paid for. But he doesn't want to mandate strict daily hours, because sometimes he wants people to work more than 8 hours in a day. So he had Alejandro put together a dashboard where he can monitor the average hours everyone works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alejandro wrote a function that takes a list of integers named `hours`, where `hours[i]` indicates the number of hours that a the employee worked on that day. The function returns an integer indicating the greatest number of contiguous work days that someone has gone where the average number of hours per day is less than x. If there is no such sequence of days, return 0.\n",
