    "## Problem\n",
    "Alejandro is working on a feature for the mobile app where users can filter for songs based on a specific chord. He wants to have one control where users can specify the notes of the chord, and another where they specify a percent. He will then filter songs to only look at those songs that have at least that percent of the song is that chord.\n",
    "\n",
    "He would like you to write a function that he can use on the backend. You will be given a target chord (for example, \"F A C E\"), and a song (which will be a list of chords), and returns a number that is the count of how many times that chord shows up in the song. Then he can have the UI calculate the percentages directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this feature, Alejandro says that all inversions of a chord and all voicings of a chord count as the same chord, but he does NOT want to consider extended chords to be the same. So \"C E G\" and \"C E G B\" are different, but \"F A C E\" and \"F C F A E\" are the same. Notes that are flatted or sharped will be denoted with a \"b\" or \"#\" respectively, and you may assume that a given song will never use two notations for the same note (that is, a song will either use \"A#\" or \"Bb\", but never both). Jean Pierre has also specified that every unique set of notes is to be considered a \"chord\", no matter how unconventional it is.\n",
